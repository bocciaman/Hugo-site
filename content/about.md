Hi my name is A.B.,

Iâ€™m a marketing professional, a Paralympic hopeful in the sport of Boccia and a relatively new YouTuber. Recently, (a.k.a 2 years ago) I started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AutomationMaestro) sharing with people some cool Mac based automations. My goal was to teach people how to make your Mac computer work for you and not the other way around.

This site will hopefully grow to become my little corner of the Internet. Mostly I'll be sharing longer length blog posts that accompany my Mac automation focused YouTube videos, other attempts at starting an online business and my interests in general.
