Hi, my name is A.B.,

I'm a marketing professional, a Paralympic hopeful in the sport of Boccia, and a relatively new YouTuber. Recently (a.k.a, Five years ago), I started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AutomationMaestro) to share some excellent macOS-based automation with people. I aim to teach people how to make their Macs work for them rather than vice versa. And yes, there are a couple of videos on my channel before I started posting regularly, but officially, my first [Keyboard Maestro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsf3EIVerCY) premiered on October 14, 2019.

This site will grow to become my little corner of the Internet. I'll share longer-length blog posts accompanying my Mac automation-focused YouTube videos, other attempts at starting an online business, and my interests in general.
