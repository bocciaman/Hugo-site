Hi my name is A.B.,

I’m a marketing professional, a Paralympic hopeful in the sport of Boccia and a relatively new YouTuber. Recently, (a.k.a 2 years ago) I started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AutomationMaestro) sharing with people some cool Mac based automations. My goal was to teach people how to make your Mac computer work for you and not the other way around.

On this website you’ll find this About page, a page with my Work Experience, a Blog page where I’ll repost my YouTube videos and thoughts about the automation demonstrated in them. A full resume is available upon request from an email link on my Work Experience page.
Then, there is The services page which is slowly being built out.
