### A structured workflow for managing credit spreads, CSPs, and covered calls — including 21-DTE management and performance analytics.

Most retail options traders:

- Track trades inconsistently  
- Guess when to manage positions  
- Don’t measure capital efficiency  
- Don’t track return vs annualized return  
- Lose structure over time  

This system replaces scattered spreadsheets with a single structured workflow.

## What This System Helps You Do

✔ Track credit spreads and wheel trades in one place  
✔ Monitor open collateral and capital deployment  
✔ Manage positions at 21-DTE with clarity  
✔ Measure ROC, Annualized ROC, and Profit Per Day  
✔ Track captured profit and long-term performance  
✔ Evaluate trade efficiency before entering a position
