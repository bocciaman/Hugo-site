## Introduction
 In my newest video, I introduce an innovative solution for those constantly curious about the day of the week for specific dates, whether it's their birthday this year or the day for an upcoming event. This tool, built into an Alfred workflow, utilizes a custom bash script to instantly determine the day of the week for any given date. This development is aimed at simplifying date-related queries without the need to navigate through calendars or online date tools. To Execute the script write the input like this: 
 
 '''
 Dte 3/24.
'''

The key feature of this Alfred workflow extends beyond just identifying the day; it's crafted to enhance overall productivity and streamline digital tasks. By activating a simple trigger, users can not only find out the day of the week for any date but also have the option to copy this information directly to their system clipboard, making planning and organization faster and more efficient.

## Conclusion
It's just a simple utility to get the any day of any date.
