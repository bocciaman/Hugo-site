## The Problem

I discovered that I had a problem on my hands when I  tried to transfer a small amount of crypto to my hardware wallet and the transfer never completed. it's now Monday, March 20, 2023 and I'm still waiting on my crypto from that scam of a company [BlockFi](https://blockfi.com). 

## Conclusion

Don't trust a company with your crypto. You should always go with a hardware wallet solution.
