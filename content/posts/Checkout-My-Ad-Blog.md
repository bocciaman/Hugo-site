Every year, the Super Bowl delivers more than just football. It delivers a cultural moment. And for many of us, the commercials are just as important as the game itself.

The 2026 Super Bowl was no different.

Brands came prepared. Big budgets. Big celebrities. Big emotional swings. Some ads were clever. Some were bold. A few were unforgettable. Others… not so much.

That’s exactly why I put together a full breakdown of my favorite commercials from this year’s Super Bowl over at [Inside That Ad](https://www.insidethatad.net/2026-super-bowl-ads/).

This isn’t just a list of ads I liked. It’s commentary. It’s analysis. It’s reaction. I go into what worked, what didn’t, and why certain spots stood out from the rest.

## Why I Watch Super Bowl Ads Closely

Super Bowl commercials aren’t random pieces of content. They’re strategic moves.

When a brand spends millions of dollars on 30 seconds of airtime, every frame is intentional. The tone, the casting, the music, the pacing — it’s all designed to send a message. Sometimes that message lands perfectly. Sometimes it misses entirely.

That tension is what makes these ads fascinating to me.

I don’t just watch them for entertainment. I watch them to understand the strategy behind them. What is the brand trying to signal? Who are they trying to reach? Are they leaning into humor, nostalgia, emotion, or shock value? And most importantly — does it feel authentic?

On [Inside That Ad](https://www.insidethatad.net/2026-super-bowl-ads/), I break that down in a straightforward way. No fluff. Just honest takes.

## My Favorite Commercials of 2026

On the site, I highlight my top picks from this year’s lineup. These are the ads that felt cohesive, creative, and aligned with the brand’s identity.

Some leaned heavily into humor. Some pulled on emotion. A few took risks that paid off. What separates the memorable ones from the forgettable ones isn’t just production value — it’s clarity of message and execution.

If you watched the Super Bowl and thought, “That one was interesting,” or “That one felt off,” you’ll probably enjoy reading the deeper breakdown.

And if you missed some of the commercials entirely, [Inside That Ad](https://www.insidethatad.net/2026-super-bowl-ads/) gives you a curated place to revisit them and see how they stack up.

## More Than Just Rankings

This isn’t about assigning random scores or declaring a single “winner.” It’s about understanding the craft of advertising.

The Super Bowl is one of the few moments when brands compete head-to-head in front of the same audience at the same time. That makes it a unique laboratory for creativity. You can see trends emerge instantly. You can feel which messages resonate. You can spot which brands are evolving and which are stuck repeating old formulas.

My commentary focuses on those themes. Why did certain ads feel fresh? Why did others feel forced? What does this year say about where advertising is heading?

If you care about marketing, storytelling, or even just well-produced content, there’s something in it for you.
