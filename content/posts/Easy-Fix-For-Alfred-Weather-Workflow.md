## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of technology, change is the only constant. This is especially true for users of the Alfred Weather workflow who have recently faced a significant challenge due to the discontinuation of Dark Sky's API. But worry not! The solution to this issue is the focus of a new, must-watch video tutorial that guides users through the process of switching to an alternative weather service for the Alfred Weather workflow.

## Understanding the Challenge

The discontinuation of Dark Sky's API, following its acquisition by Apple, has left many users in a lurch. Dark Sky was a popular choice for the Alfred Weather workflow due to its accurate and detailed weather data. However, with the service no longer providing API keys, it's become imperative for users to adapt their workflow setup.

## The Solution at Hand

The good news is that there are other weather services available that can fill the void left by Dark Sky. The tutorial is designed for users who have already secured a working API key from an alternative weather service. The video provides a step-by-step guide to integrate this new service into your Alfred Weather workflow.

## Conclusion: Embracing Change

I decided to create the video because neither the [Alfred Forum](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1996-weather-workflow/) or the [Weather Workflow GitHub](https://github.com/jason0x43/alfred-weather) were much help in understanding how to change the active weather service for the workflow.
