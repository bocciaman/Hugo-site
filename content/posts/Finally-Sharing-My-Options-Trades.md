## I'm Back for Real
I'm finally back for real this time. Today marks the first day that I've posted a video since August of 2025. I wrote about why I haven't posted much in my [Why I've Been Gone](https://abanwar.com/why-ive-been-gone/) blog post. This video has a different style than the ones I'm usually making about Mac automation. This one is similar to a YouTube Short — but it really isn’t. I explained that I’ll be making more videos about options, investing, and walking through the four positions that I currently have open in my Robinhood account.

By the way, if you're interested in opening a Robinhood account, sign up with my [Robinhood invite link](https://join.robinhood.com/abdalla62) and we’ll both get to pick our own gift stock.

So far, I have four option trade positions open. They are four put credit spreads to be exact, with the underlying assets being SPY and QQQ.

### A New Chapter for the Channel
For a long time, this site and my YouTube channel were focused almost entirely on Mac automation. AppleScript, Shortcuts, Keyboard Maestro — that was my world. And I still love automation. That part of me hasn’t gone anywhere.

But over the past year, another passion has grown just as strong: **systematic investing and options trading**.

Rather than keep these worlds separate, I’ve decided to bring both together. Automation is about building systems. Options trading — when done correctly — is also about building systems. Rules. Probabilities. Risk management. Repeatable processes. That overlap is exactly what excites me.

So going forward, you’ll see content that covers:

- Real options trades — publicly documented  
- Step-by-step trade planning  
- Risk and probability explanations  
- Trade management at specific DTE points  
- Portfolio growth strategies  
- And eventually — automation tools to manage it all  

This is not “get rich quick” content. It’s me building something real, transparently, one trade at a time.

### Why I’m Posting Real Trades Publicly

Most trading content online is either:

1. Pure theory with no real positions  
2. Fake “paper trades”  
3. Or cherry-picked wins  

I want this channel to be different.

My goal is simple:

- Build a systematic options income stream  
- Document real trades transparently  
- Improve week after week  

That means showing entries, management decisions, wins, and losses. No hiding. No hindsight edits. Just real progress over time.

### Current Portfolio Snapshot

Right now, I have four open positions. All are **put credit spreads**. The underlying assets are:

- SPY  
- QQQ  

These are broad-market index ETFs — highly liquid, tight spreads, and ideal for systematic strategies. I’ll be breaking down:

- Why I chose these underlyings  
- How I selected strikes  
- What delta means in practical terms  
- My target days-to-expiration  
- My profit-taking rules  
- My risk limits  

Each trade will serve as a learning example — not just for viewers, but for me as well.

### What You Can Expect Going Forward

Here’s what’s coming next:

- Regular trade updates  
- Weekly portfolio check-ins  
- Strategy refinements  
- Lessons learned from real outcomes  
- Occasional Mac automation tools that support trading workflows  
- And continued improvements to this website  

I’m not disappearing again. This time, the content has a clear direction and purpose.

### Final Thoughts

If you’ve followed my site for Mac automation — They will still be here and more automation videos to come.  
If you’re here for investing — welcome aboard from the beginning.

Either way, I’m glad you’re here.

And yes — **I’m back for real**.
