## The Situation

First, we'll show you how to change the color of the folder icons. Simply select the folder you want to customize, right-click on it, and choose "Get Info." In the "Get Info" window, click on the folder icon in the top left corner. Then, select "Edit" from the menu bar and choose "Copy." Next, open Preview and select "New from Clipboard" under the "File" menu. This will create a new image of the folder icon that you can now customize.

In Preview, you can change the color of the folder by selecting "Tools" from the menu bar and choosing "Adjust Color." Here, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness to create your custom color. Once you're happy with the new color, save the image to your desktop.

Now, go back to the "Get Info" window for the folder you want to customize and click on the folder icon again. This time, select "Edit" and then "Paste" to replace the default blue folder icon with your custom color.

## Conclusion

There must be a way to automate this process. if I  find it, I'll let y'all know. in the mean time, Apple please give us a way to do this already without going through a multi-step workaround. This seams like a feature we should have already without requiring third-part software or this workaround.
