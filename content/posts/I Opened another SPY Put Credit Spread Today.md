One of the biggest mistakes new options traders make is jumping into trades without a repeatable system. Random entries, emotional exits, and no tracking usually lead to inconsistent results.

That’s why every trade I take follows the same framework:

**Plan → Execute → Track → Review**

In this post, I’ll walk you through the **SPY put credit spread** I opened today, explain why I took it, and show how I track every position using my custom Google Sheets journal. If your goal is building **monthly options income**, this is the exact process I follow.

## Why I Trade SPY Put Credit Spreads

SPY (the S&P 500 ETF) has one of the most liquid options markets in the world. Tight bid/ask spreads, massive volume, and reliable price behavior make it ideal for systematic income strategies.

A **put credit spread** allows me to:

- Collect upfront premium  
- Define maximum risk  
- Avoid unlimited downside  
- Trade high-probability setups  

Instead of guessing market direction, I focus on placing trades where SPY simply needs to **stay above my short strike** by expiration.

It’s not about hitting home runs.  
It’s about stacking consistent wins over time.

## The Trade I Opened Today

Today I opened a new **SPY put credit spread**. My objective with each trade is simple:

- Choose a strike with a high probability of success  
- Keep risk defined  
- Size the position responsibly  
- Let time decay do the heavy lifting  

My trade checklist always follows the same structure:

- 45–60 days to expiration  
- Short strike near 0.25–0.30 delta  
- Spread width matched to account risk  
- Minimum credit threshold met  

Once those conditions line up, I execute the trade and immediately log it into my tracking system.

## Why Tracking Matters More Than the Trade

Here’s a truth most traders ignore:

**If you don’t track your trades, you don’t know your real edge.**

Memory lies. Broker history is messy. Screenshots don’t scale.  
A structured trading journal turns random trades into a real strategy.

That’s why I built a **Put Credit Spread Tracker**, a Google Sheets journal that automatically logs:

- Entry date  
- Expiration  
- Strikes  
- Credit received  
- Maximum risk  
- Days in trade  
- Return on risk  
- Profit / loss  
- Exit notes  

If you want the exact tracker I use, you can get it here:

It’s designed specifically for:

- SPY credit spreads  
- Defined-risk strategies  
- Income-focused traders  
- Clean performance tracking  

No bloated dashboards. Just what matters.

## Risk Management Keeps You in the Game

Most traders fail not because their strategy is bad — but because their **risk management is poor**.

Every spread I open follows strict rules:

- Risk only a small portion of the account per trade  
- Avoid over-leveraging margin  
- Take profits early near 50% when available  
- Exit if the trade thesis breaks  

The goal isn’t to win every trade.  
The goal is to **stay in the game long enough for probability to work**.

This mindset alone separates consistent traders from gamblers.

## My Long-Term Plan: Monthly Income from Options

My broader strategy is to build a portfolio where SPY credit spreads generate monthly income while long-term holdings grow in parallel.

I run a simple two-lane system:

- **Lane 1:** Options income  
- **Lane 2:** Long-term portfolio growth  

This creates a powerful compounding engine over time.

If you’re starting from scratch and need a brokerage account, Robinhood makes entry simple. You can even get a **free share of stock** when you sign up using my referral link:

## A Book I Recommend Before Trading

If you’re new to options, don’t skip education.

One of the better beginner-friendly books I’ve read is:

**The Unlucky Investor’s Guide to Option Trading**  
https://amzn.to/4jIHLwu

It covers:

- Core options mechanics  
- Common beginner mistakes  
- Risk management principles  
- Real-world examples  

It’s not a get-rich-quick gimmick — it’s practical.

## Building a Repeatable Trading System

The difference between random trading and professional trading is **process consistency**.

Every trade I take goes through:

     
1. Probability check  
2. Risk sizing  
3. Execution  
4. Immediate tracking  
5. Planned exit rules  

No emotional decisions.  
No chasing.  
No guessing.

Over time, this builds:

- Reliable performance data  
- Confidence in execution  
- Clear strategy refinement  

That’s where real growth happens.

## Final Thoughts

Opening a SPY put credit spread isn’t complicated.  
What matters is **doing it the same way every time**.

Defined risk.  
High probability.  
Proper tracking.

That’s the entire edge.

If you're serious about building monthly options income, start with:

- A repeatable trade plan  
- A proper tracking system  
- Controlled position sizing  
- Continuous review  

Do that — and results naturally improve.

I’ll continue sharing real trades and real tracking in upcoming posts.

Stay tuned.
