## A Rough Day in the Market

Today was one of those days where you log into your brokerage account and immediately feel that sinking feeling. The market was down, and while the headline number might not look catastrophic, the impact on my options positions definitely stung. At one point, I was down over $330 on the day, which is never fun to see — especially when things looked much better just 24 hours earlier.

To make matters worse, the first version of the video I recorded today had no audio. So yes, I got to relive the entire experience twice.

On the bright side, I did add about **$800 to the portfolio today**, which helps reinforce the long-term mindset. Still, days like this test your patience and your process.

## What Happened to My Options Positions

Let’s start with my **SPY 660/650 put credit spread**. This position had been behaving nicely, but today it slipped back down into the **$36–$37 range**. Not disastrous, but certainly frustrating when you’ve already seen higher unrealized profits.

My **QQQ position**, which was sitting around **$72 in profit yesterday**, dropped all the way back down to **$37 today**. That reversal was especially annoying because nothing about the trade itself changed — just the market mood.

Then there’s the SPY put spread that was opened **by accident as part of a roll**. That one is now down between **$200 and $230**, compared to about **-$198 earlier**. I’m honestly not sure if this one will end up profitable anymore. Every time there’s a market downswing, these spreads seem to lose value exponentially, not linearly.

Another **QQQ 613/603 put spread**, opened just yesterday, is now down **$31**, after being up **$13** the day before. And my **SPY 665/655 spread**, opened on Monday, is now down **$11**.

In short: it was not a pretty day across the board.

## Why I’m Not Panicking (Yet)

The key thing is that **I don’t need to close anything today**.

For example, the SPY 660/650 spread won’t be managed until **February 6**, which marks **21 DTE**, unless it hits my profit target of around **$60–$61** beforehand. That’s why I already have a **pending limit order** in place. If it hits, great — the trade closes automatically. If not, I’ll deal with it at the proper management window.

This is exactly why I stick to rules-based trading. Emotional decisions made on red days are how small losses turn into big ones.

## Positions I’m Not Worried About

The one position I genuinely don’t care about right now is **Archer Aviation**. I have an **$11 covered call** that’s currently up about **$45**, but it doesn’t expire until **April 14**. If the shares get called away, that’s fine. If not, I keep the premium and run another covered call.

The premium on Archer isn’t amazing — the options chain is pretty sparse and feels more like a quarterly than a monthly setup — but it serves its purpose.

## The Rest of the Portfolio

Outside of options, things are mixed but mostly stable:

- **VTI** is down slightly, but that’s a long-term hold I never worry about.
- **Apple** is up today.
- **SCHD, ABBV, O, and CVX** are all up.
- Chevron, in particular, continues to be a favorite of mine. I honestly wish I had bought more when it was cheaper. I wouldn’t be shocked to see it hit **$200–$210** by the end of the year.
- **BND** is doing what bonds do — nothing exciting.
- **Citigroup** is performing well.
- **Devon Energy** is finally green after being a losing position for a long time. I’m up about **$56**, but I only have **31 shares**. I really wish I had built that position to 100 shares so I could run covered calls on it.

## The Question I Keep Asking Myself

This brings me to one of the biggest questions I still wrestle with:

> Is it worth holding small positions — 10 shares, 31 shares — when that capital could be concentrated into positions where I can actually trade options?

Ever since I started trading options seriously, I’ve felt that **every equity position should ideally be at least 100 shares**. That flexibility matters. A stock without options income potential feels incomplete to me now.

And yet, here I am, holding several positions that don’t meet that threshold.

## Final Thoughts

Days like today aren’t fun, but they’re part of the process. This is a real account, real money, and real decision-making — not a highlight reel. I’m sticking to my rules, managing risk, and letting time do its job.

As always, these trades are **mine alone**. I’m not a financial, legal, or tax advisor, and none of this is advice. If you’re making financial decisions, consult a qualified professional and do your own research.
