## Why I Bought This Kettle

Since moving back to my U.S. apartment, I’ve been rebuilding my kitchen setup from scratch. One of the first essentials on my list was a reliable electric kettle. I drink tea daily, occasionally make pour-over coffee, and also need hot water fast for instant meals. After comparing several options on Amazon, I decided to buy the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)**.

I’ve now been using this kettle regularly, and here’s my honest, real-world experience.

## First Impressions Out of the Box

When the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)** arrived, the first thing I noticed was how compact it is. With a 1-liter capacity (about four cups), it’s perfect for a studio apartment or small kitchen like mine. It doesn’t hog counter space, yet it still feels sturdy and well built.

The stainless steel finish gives it a clean, modern look. It blends nicely with other appliances and doesn’t feel like cheap plastic — which is important since it’s something I leave on the counter full-time.

Setup was instant. Plug in the base, place the kettle on top, fill with water, and press the switch. No complicated controls or confusing instructions.

## Fast Boiling That Actually Saves Time

One of the biggest reasons I chose the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)** was the 1500W fast-boil feature. And yes — it really does heat water in about three minutes.

That may not sound dramatic, but when you’re making tea in the morning or a quick coffee before work, shaving off several minutes matters. Compared to boiling water on a stovetop, this feels significantly faster and more convenient.

The blue LED lights that glow during heating are a nice touch too. They let you know it’s working, and they automatically turn off once the water is boiled. It’s simple, but visually reassuring.

---

## Built-In Tea Infuser = Game Changer

As someone who drinks loose-leaf tea, I love that the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)** includes a removable stainless steel infuser.

Instead of boiling water separately and then steeping tea in another pot or mug, I can just drop loose leaves into the infuser, boil the water, and let it steep directly in the kettle. When it’s ready, I remove the infuser and pour.

This is especially convenient when making multiple cups. If you entertain guests or just want several refills without re-boiling each time, this feature saves effort.

The infuser is stainless steel, BPA-free, and easy to rinse clean. No lingering tea stains so far.

---

## Cordless Convenience & Easy Pouring

Another underrated feature is the cordless design. The base stays plugged in, while the kettle lifts off freely. That makes pouring water at the table or counter much easier.

The 360-degree swivel base also means you can place the kettle back on the base from any angle — small detail, but surprisingly convenient when you’re half-awake in the morning.

The spout pours cleanly with no dripping. I haven’t had water running down the side, which is something cheaper kettles often struggle with.

---

## Safety Features I Appreciate

Safety matters, especially with an appliance that heats water this fast. The **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)** includes automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection.

That means if you forget to turn it off or accidentally start it without enough water, it shuts down automatically. This gives peace of mind, especially in a busy household or when multitasking.

---

## The One Thing I Don’t Like

Now for the honest part — there’s only one design detail I don’t love.

The lid on the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)** is fully removable rather than hinged. While this does make cleaning easier, it also means that when you open the kettle, the lid comes completely off and needs to be placed somewhere.

In practice, that usually means putting it on the kitchen counter. And if you’re like me and care about kitchen hygiene, placing a lid that goes back over boiling water onto a countertop can feel slightly unsanitary.

It’s not a deal-breaker by any means, but I would have preferred a hinged lid design. That’s the only real complaint I have — everything else has worked exactly as expected.

---

## Cleaning & Maintenance

Cleaning the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)** is straightforward. Because the lid fully removes, you can easily reach inside. A quick rinse after each use keeps it fresh.

If you live in an area with hard water, occasional descaling with vinegar or lemon water keeps it performing well. The stainless steel interior doesn’t retain odors or flavors.

## Who This Kettle Is Best For

Based on my experience, the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)** is ideal for:

- Tea drinkers who use loose-leaf tea  
- Coffee lovers needing fast hot water  
- Small apartments or dorm rooms  
- Travelers wanting a compact kettle  
- Anyone who values speed and simplicity  

If you need a massive family-sized kettle, this 1L version might feel small. But for one to two people, it’s perfect.

## Final Verdict

After using it daily, I’m genuinely happy I bought the **[Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser](https://amzn.to/4abUeFH)**. It boils fast, looks sleek, includes a useful infuser, and fits my small kitchen perfectly. The safety features work well, and pouring is mess-free.

The only downside is the fully removable lid — slightly inconvenient and mildly unsanitary — but not enough to outweigh the benefits.

If you’re looking for a compact, fast, and practical electric kettle, I can confidently recommend it.
