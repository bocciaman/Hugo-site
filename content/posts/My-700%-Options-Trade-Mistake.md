## A Painful Lesson in Options Trading Discipline

Every options trader eventually has a story about **the trade that taught them the hard lesson**. This is mine. In this post, I walk through a **700% paper-loss mistake** on a put credit spread — what went wrong, how it happened, and most importantly, **what I learned**.  

If you’re trading credit spreads, cash-secured puts, or building an options income strategy, this is the kind of real-world experience you rarely see shared honestly. No fake guru wins. No hindsight perfection. Just a real trader documenting a real mistake so it doesn’t happen again.

## This is a doozy

I made an options trading error that always seems to cost more than the wins that I actually get. In this video, I explain how I opened a **put credit spread with $20-wide strikes** — far wider than I normally trade. That extra width dramatically increased volatility and risk exposure.  

Almost immediately after entry, the position moved sharply against me. At one point, the trade showed a **700% paper loss** — not realized yet, but large enough to get your attention. Expiration isn’t until **March 20, 2026**, so there’s still time for recovery. But whether it recovers or not, the mistake was already made at entry.

And that’s the key point: **Most options losses are decided the moment you click “Confirm.”**

## Video Breakdown

In the video, I walk through the exact position, the platform screen, and the thought process that led me into the trade. If you're following my channel or trading journal, this is part of my commitment to **publicly documenting real trades — wins and mistakes alike**.

## First Mistake — Breaking My Own Trading Plan

My first mistake was simple: **I didn’t follow my own rules.**

I only trade on **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday**. That schedule keeps me disciplined, prevents impulsive trades, and aligns with my goal of systematic options income trading.  

But this time, I broke the rule.

It was a **Tuesday**, right after the MLK holiday. The market had dropped more than **2%**, volatility spiked, and instead of sticking to my plan, I decided to open a new put credit spread to “continue the campaign.”

That’s classic emotional trading:
- Seeing red candles  
- Feeling pressure to act  
- Convincing yourself it’s an opportunity  

In reality, it was impatience disguised as strategy.

The trades I shared in my [first options video](https://abanwar.com/finally-sharing-my-options-trades/) were much more disciplined. This one wasn’t. And as Murphy’s Law goes — **what can go wrong, will go wrong**.

## Second Mistake — Ignoring a Warning Sign I Didn’t Understand

![Minus Chain CSP Tracker](/img/minuschain.webp)

While selecting my strikes, I noticed a **minus symbol** next to the options chain. I wasn’t fully sure what it meant or how to clear it.  

But instead of stopping and researching, I pushed forward and executed the trade anyway.

That’s the second big lesson:

**Never execute a trade you don’t fully understand.**

Nine times out of ten, when you ignore confusion at entry, the market will eventually force you to understand — through losses.

In this case, that minus sign was a platform-specific indicator tied to how the chain was being displayed. It didn’t cause the loss directly — but it was a clear signal that I wasn’t fully in control of the situation when entering the trade.

And in options trading, uncertainty at entry is unacceptable.

## Third Mistake — Letting Greed Override Risk Management

The third mistake was greed.

I’m constantly working to build a **consistent options income system**. I want repeatable monthly returns. I want to scale this. I want it to become semi-passive income.

But here’s the truth:

**Options trading is never passive.**

You must respect:
- Market conditions  
- Volatility changes  
- Correlation risk  
- Proper position sizing  

In this trade, I widened my strikes more than usual to collect extra premium. More premium means more risk. And when combined with bad timing and broken discipline, that risk multiplied quickly.

Less frequent, well-planned trading keeps you in the game. Overtrading and chasing premium does the opposite.

The market isn’t going anywhere. There will always be another opportunity tomorrow. But there may not be another account if you blow this one up.

## Where the Trade Stands Now

As of writing this post, the trade is still open. It may recover. It may not. Time will tell.

But regardless of outcome, the damage was done the moment I:
- Traded outside my plan  
- Entered without full clarity  
- Sized risk inconsistently  

That combination is what creates big drawdowns.

---

## The Real Takeaway

This wasn’t a market problem.  
It wasn’t bad luck.  
It was **process failure**.

And that’s good news — because process can be fixed.

My path forward is simple:
- Stick to approved trading days  
- Never enter unclear setups  
- Keep strike width consistent  
- Respect volatility  
- Slow down entries  

The goal remains the same: **build a systematic, sustainable options income strategy** — but with better discipline and cleaner execution.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re trading options, especially put credit spreads, learn from this post. Losses happen. But **avoidable losses hurt the most**.

I’m sharing this publicly because trading improves fastest when you stop hiding mistakes and start analyzing them.

More trades.  
More data.  
More discipline.  
Better results.

The journey continues.
