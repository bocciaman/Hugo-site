## Zapier

In this video, I'll introduce you to Zapier, the powerful automation tool that connects your favorite apps and services. If you're tired of manually moving data between different applications, Zapier can help you streamline your workflow and save you time with the wonderful magic of automation.

During this video, I'll show you how I  created my first "zap" (Zapier's term for an automated workflow) and walk you through the process step-by-step. Mine "zap" was pretty simple; anytime there is a new video on my channel, a tweet is sent out with the message: "Hey all, check out the latest video from my channel": with the video title and the link.

## Pros

Another automation tool under your belt and its OS egnostic. Can connect to many different web based services that you may have not thought of for automation before you were introduced to Zapier.

## Cons

The tool is very touchy and may require a lot of trial and error before an automation looks exactly the way you want it to look. On my tweet, the image wasn't very clear as if I  selected the wrong image size. 

## Conclusion

I plan to continue using Zapier and making an automation series out of it.
