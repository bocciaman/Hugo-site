## State of the Portfolio (01-31-2026)

In this video, I take a step back and do something I think is just as important as placing trades: I review the current state of the portfolio and explain *why* I made certain decisions — including one trade I **did not** take.

Earlier in the week, I mentioned that I was considering opening a **broken wing butterfly** position on Friday. Friday came and went, and that trade never happened. This post explains why, what I was seeing in the market at the time, and how that decision fits into my broader approach to options trading.

## Why I Skipped the Broken Wing Butterfly

Let’s start with the decision that probably raised the most questions: **why I didn’t open the broken wing butterfly**.

The short answer is simple: **the setup wasn’t good enough**.

One of the biggest mistakes traders make — especially in options — is feeling obligated to trade just because they said they would or because a strategy is “on the calendar.” Markets don’t care about our plans. They care about price, volatility, and liquidity.

By Friday, the pricing, implied volatility, and risk/reward profile of the broken wing butterfly didn’t align with what I look for. The trade was still *possible*, but it wasn’t *attractive*. And there’s a big difference between the two.

Passing on a trade is not a failure. In many cases, it’s the most profitable move you can make.

## Discipline Over Activity

This decision ties into a broader theme I talk about often: **discipline beats activity**.

It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that more trades equal more progress. In reality, overtrading is one of the fastest ways to slowly bleed an account. Every position you open adds complexity, emotional load, and downside risk.

My goal with this portfolio isn’t to trade every day. It’s to:
- Take *high-probability* setups  
- Size positions responsibly  
- Avoid unnecessary exposure  
- Let time and probabilities do the heavy lifting  

If a trade doesn’t meet those criteria, I’m comfortable sitting on my hands.

## Where the Current Holdings Stand

I also walk through the current holdings and address the question everyone asks at some point: **are we up or down right now?**

The honest answer is: *it depends on the position*.

Some positions are currently showing unrealized gains, others are down on paper. That’s normal. Options portfolios rarely move in a straight line, especially when you’re dealing with spreads, time decay, and volatility shifts.

What matters more than short-term P/L is:
- Whether the trade thesis is still valid  
- Whether risk is defined and acceptable  
- Whether adjustments are needed  

A temporary drawdown doesn’t automatically mean a bad trade. Just like a temporary gain doesn’t mean a good one.

## Managing Expectations in a Volatile Market

Market conditions right now are not exactly calm. Volatility has a way of making even well-structured trades feel uncomfortable. This is where experience — and restraint — come into play.

Instead of reacting emotionally to every red or green candle, I focus on:
- Time to expiration  
- Delta exposure  
- Max risk vs. max reward  
- Whether price is behaving as expected  

If nothing has structurally changed, there’s often no reason to panic or intervene prematurely.

## What I’m Watching for the Coming Week

Looking ahead, I outline the **moves I’m considering for the coming week**, but I do so intentionally without locking myself into anything.

Markets evolve quickly. A setup that looks promising on Sunday can look completely different by Monday morning. My plan going into the next week is to stay flexible and patient.

I’m watching for:
- Better-defined entries  
- Cleaner volatility pricing  
- Opportunities that don’t require constant monitoring  

If those show up, I’ll act. If they don’t, I won’t force it.

## Trading Is a Process, Not a Performance

One thing I want to emphasize — especially for newer traders — is that trading isn’t about putting on a show. It’s about building a **repeatable process**.

Skipping a trade doesn’t make for flashy content, but it *does* make for better long-term results. The real edge in options trading often comes from what you **don’t** do.

This portfolio is being run with longevity in mind. I’m not chasing hero trades or trying to outsmart the market every week. I’m focused on consistency, risk control, and learning from every decision — including the ones that result in no trade at all.

## Final Thoughts

This update is less about wins or losses and more about transparency and decision-making. If you’re following along, I want you to see the full picture — not just the trades that get placed, but the ones that get passed on.

The market will always offer another opportunity. Protecting capital and staying disciplined ensures you’re still around to take it.

As always, I’ll continue to document these decisions in real time and share how the portfolio evolves. Sometimes the most important move is knowing when to step back, reassess, and wait for a better pitch.
