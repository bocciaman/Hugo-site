## Introduction

Welcome back to another upgraded tutorial! Today, we're diving deeper into the world of automation and productivity tools. If you're already familiar with my previous video 'Copy Page Titles and URLs With Ease', you're going to love this one. I'm came up with a better and more precise tool to use in tandem with AppleScript, the grandaddy of Mac automation tools - Keyboard Maestro.

## Keyboard Maestro: A Better Way to Automate this Task

While I've always been a fan of TextExpander and its reliable automation capabilities, I've recently discovered that Keyboard Maestro offers a unique advantage when it comes to copying and pasting URLs and titles. The key difference lies in its two-step process, which adds a layer of precision that's lacking in TextExpander's approach.

To use Keyboard Maestro, all you need to do is copy using Caps lock + C and paste separately with Command + V. This ensures that you're copying and pasting exactly what you intend to, rather than running the risk of copying from the wrong window.

## Addressing TextExpander's Limitations

One of the issues I've noticed with TextExpander when using this specific automation is that it automatically copies the URL and title of the currently active window. This can create problems if you're in an application like Gmail, for example. It might copy the URL and title of your Gmail page rather than the page you intended to copy from. This could lead to a significant waste of time and potential errors, especially if you're dealing with sensitive information or are in a rush.

However, with Keyboard Maestro's two-step process, you completely control what gets pated where. You can easily verify your actions at each step, ensuring that you're working with the correct information. This automation gives you complete freedom and flexibility of where to paste and a more precise level of accuracy.

Both TextExpander and Keyboard Maestro are fantastic automation tools that I use daily. In fact, I love  TextExpander so much that I  believe everyone should at least try it. You can sign up now for [TextExpander](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1244193&amp;u=2423013&amp;m=81274&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=) and save 20%.They each have their strengths and areas of specialization. However, when it comes to the specific task of copying and pasting URLs and titlesvia AppleScript, I've found Keyboard Maestro to be more accurate and flexible.

## AppleScript

```applescript
tell application "Safari"
	set windowName to name of window 1
	set windowURL to URL of document 1
end tell

set the clipboard to "[" & windowName & "](" & windowURL & ")"
``` 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, enhancing productivity is all about finding the right tools that match your specific needs. While TextExpander is a great tool, Keyboard Maestro provides a more precise and reliable method for automating the copying and pasting of URLs and titles.

So, if you're looking for an upgrade to your automation toolkit, Keyboard Maestro is definitely worth a try. Join me in this tutorial video to learn how to use it effectively and see how it can streamline your copy-paste tasks. Once you've experienced the precision and efficiency of Keyboard Maestro, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it!
