AppCleaner is a great tool to use if you want to ensure that all the files associated with an application are completely removed from your Mac.

## Command line

The video links to a separate video on how to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for the first time, and then shows you how to use the Homebrew uninstall command to remove an application from your Mac. This method can be useful for those who prefer using the command line or want to automate the uninstallation process.
