In this video, I show three iOS commands with a Harry Potter theme. Yes, I know this is a relatively short video, but I thought it would be a fun one to share with everybody. There are three Harry Potter voice command that could be viewed as Harry Potter spells.

### Conclusion
Saying the commands in the video will activate and deacvtivate the flasglight. Ther third one will activate any app you'd like to launch. Enjoy being Harry Potter with your iOS device.
