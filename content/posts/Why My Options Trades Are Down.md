In this **Portfolio Update (02-24-2026)**, I break down my open options positions and answer one of the most searched questions in options trading:

**Why am I down on my options trade when the stock is above my strike price?**

If you’re trading credit spreads, selling puts, or managing short premium strategies, you’ve likely experienced this. The stock moves in your favor. Your strike is safe. Yet your position still shows red.

Let’s unpack why that happens.

## Why Options Can Show Losses Above the Strike

Options pricing is not just about direction. It’s about probability, volatility, and time.

Even if a stock is trading well above your short strike in a put credit spread, the position can temporarily show a loss because of:

- Implied volatility expansion  
- Remaining time to expiration (DTE)  
- Changes in market sentiment  
- Bid/ask spread inefficiencies  

When volatility rises, options become more expensive. If you’re an options seller, that works against you short term. The mark-to-market value increases, and your spread can appear negative — even though the probability of success hasn’t materially changed.

This is where understanding **time decay (theta)** becomes critical.

Time decay accelerates as expiration approaches. Early in the trade, it feels slow. Later, it compounds. If your thesis remains intact, patience is often part of the strategy.

This is exactly why I emphasize structured trade management rather than emotional reactions.

If you’re looking for a simple way to track DTE, profit targets, and trade rules, I built a clean tracking tool here:

It helps remove emotion and replaces it with consistency.

## Should You Panic When Your Spread Turns Red?

Short answer: No.

Long answer: It depends on whether your original assumptions are still valid.

If the underlying hasn’t broken your thesis and you’re still within your planned DTE management window, temporary losses are often part of options selling.

This is something newer traders don’t hear enough: **being temporarily red does not automatically mean you’re wrong.**

## Adding CLM and CRF for Monthly Income

In this update, I also added positions in:

- CLM (Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund)  
- CRF (Cornerstone Total Return Fund)

These high-yield closed-end funds are part of my broader monthly income strategy.

When evaluating funds like CLM and CRF, I look beyond headline yield. Distribution yield is attractive, but understanding NAV behavior, rights offerings, and premium/discount dynamics is essential.

These funds are not “buy and forget.” They require monitoring. But when combined with options premium, they can create a layered income approach.

The goal isn’t chasing yield — it’s building durable cash flow.
