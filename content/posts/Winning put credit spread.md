## Closing a SPY Put Credit Spread Early: Why a Small Win Still Matters

Today I wanted to share a quick update on one of my SPY put credit spreads that I closed earlier than expiration. This wasn’t a massive win, and it wasn’t one of those textbook 50% profit closes either. Instead, it was a modest, intentional decision that resulted in about a 30% gain. On paper, that worked out to roughly $38 in realized profit.

At first glance, $38 doesn’t sound exciting. It’s not the kind of number that makes for flashy screenshots or bold claims on social media. But trades like this are actually the backbone of my options trading approach, and I think they’re worth talking about—especially if you’re focused on consistency rather than home runs.

### The Details of the Trade

This SPY put credit spread was opened on December 29, 2025, and I closed it today, February 2, 2026. When I opened the position, I collected $128 in premium. To close the trade, I paid $90 to buy it back. After subtracting that cost, the net result was a $38 profit.

That’s it. No drama, no last-minute expiration gamble, and no holding on just to squeeze out a few extra dollars while risking a sudden market move. The trade did what it needed to do, and I took the money off the table.

### Why Close at Only 30%?

A lot of options traders aim for a clean 50% of max profit as a rule. I respect that approach, and I often use it myself. But rules are guidelines, not handcuffs. In this case, the remaining reward simply wasn’t compelling enough relative to the risk of keeping the position open.

Markets can change quickly, especially when you’re dealing with an index like SPY. Even if nothing dramatic seems to be happening, holding a position longer than necessary exposes you to overnight gaps, unexpected news, or sudden volatility spikes. Locking in a smaller gain can sometimes be the smarter decision, particularly when capital can be freed up for the next opportunity.

### Tracking the Trade Beyond Robinhood

One thing I always emphasize is tracking trades outside of the brokerage platform. Robinhood does a fine job of showing realized profit and loss across all trades, but it doesn’t give me the clarity I want for specific strategies.

That’s why I maintain a dedicated tracker for my SPY put credit spreads. This spreadsheet only includes SPY trades, which makes it much easier to evaluate how this one strategy is performing over time without the noise of other positions.

In the tracker, you’ll notice a higher cumulative number than what you might expect based on currently closed trades. That’s because the sheet adds up several line items, including trades that were part of rolls. Some of those positions aren’t fully closed yet, but they still appear in the running totals. This can make the number look inflated if you don’t understand the context, which is why I always stress knowing what your data actually represents.

### The Cost of Strategy Drift

Looking at the tracker also highlights something else that’s important: consistency matters. If I had stuck exclusively to SPY put credit spreads, the overall profit would be significantly higher than what shows up in my [Robinhood](https://join.robinhood.com/abdalla62) account.

[Robinhood](https://join.robinhood.com/abdalla62) tracks everything—SPY, QQQ, experimental trades, rolls, adjustments, and the occasional detour into something that looked interesting at the time. My SPY tracker, on the other hand, shows what happens when I focus on a single, repeatable strategy.

This isn’t about regret. It’s about awareness. Strategy drift is easy, especially when markets are volatile or when you see other traders posting big wins. But over time, simplicity and repetition tend to win. This trade, small as it was, reinforces that lesson.

### Small Profits Add Up

It’s easy to dismiss a $38 profit as insignificant, but that mindset can be dangerous. Options trading is not about any single trade; it’s about the cumulative effect of many small, disciplined decisions.

A series of $30–$50 wins, combined with risk management and position sizing, can quietly compound into meaningful results. More importantly, these trades build confidence, reinforce good habits, and keep emotions in check. There’s real value in closing a trade, booking a profit, and moving on without second-guessing yourself.

### Closing Thoughts

This was a short update, but I think it highlights an important point: not every trade needs to be exciting to be successful. Sometimes the best move is to take a modest profit, free up capital, and live to trade another day.

I’ll continue sharing these kinds of trades—wins, small wins, and lessons—because they reflect what real trading looks like when you’re focused on sustainability rather than hype.

That’s all for now. I’ll see you in the next update.
