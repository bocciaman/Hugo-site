In this video I walk you through the pros and cons of two iOS clipboard managers. One is called Clippo and it's an app you can purchase from the App Store. The other is a clipboard manager shortcut that I downloaded from snows YouTuber Christopher Lawley.

## Clippo
Is the paid clipboard manager that you can download from the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clippo-clipboard-manager/id1092865336). To Start using the app, you have to copy the text you want to save in clipboard first, then open Clippo where you'll be asked if you want to save the text, then it will be saved in an internal list. It does have advanced options like sending copied text to the Mac but this feature doesn't work consitantly.  
- Advanced settings

## Clipboard Manager Shortcut
I prefer the clipboard manager shortcut over Clippo even though it is dependent on the [Data Jar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/data-jar/id1453273600)app to store the copied content. The clipboard manager shortcut primarily works via notifications but in my video the application didn't work - just my luck, I guess.

## Conclusion
I'll always prefer native, free apps over over paid, third-party ones.
