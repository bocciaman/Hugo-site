## Hazel

Hazel is a file monitoring app that you can use to set up fules to monitor file movement and updates to all your files and folders. In the video, I  demonstrated how you can create several rules to keep your desktop free of clutter. I did this by employing a three pronged folder approach:

- Desktop Clutter Folder
	- Screenshot - keeps screenshots separate for a month
	- Images - keeps images separate for a month
	- Docs - keeps documents separate for a month

- Google Drive Folder - After files have lived in the clutter folder for a month, they are automatically moved here. 

All of this is automated via Hazel rules. 

## Where To Get It

Hazel is owned by a company called [noodlesoft](https://www.noodlesoft.com) and it can be purchased for $42. There is a free trial period for the software though - always a plus.

## Conclusion

Hazel is one of three starter software for automation heaven. So if your interested in Mac automation Hazel is definitely a must have. And no I'm not sponsored by them nor am I an affiliate marketer for them. I just believe in the software.
