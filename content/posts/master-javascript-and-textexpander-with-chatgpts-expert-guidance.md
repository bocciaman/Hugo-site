## Introduction

Are you tired of spending hours copying and pasting data from URLs into your documents or spreadsheets? Do you want to streamline your workflow and increase your productivity? Look no further than TextExpander and Javascript, with the help of ChatGBT.

## ChatGBT and Javascript

In a recent video, I demonstrated how ChatGBT assisted me in creating a TextExpander snippet that automated the copy and paste process for collecting ticket numbers from a URL. By utilizing ChatGBT's advanced natural language processing capabilities and my own Javascript skills, I was able to develop a powerful tool that saved me time and effort.

The process began by identifying the specific information I wanted to collect from a given URL. In this case, it was ticket numbers for a customer support system. Once I had determined the data points I needed, I turned to ChatGBT to help me create the Javascript code necessary to extract that information.

Using natural language commands, I was able to communicate with ChatGBT and receive assistance with writing the code. With ChatGBT's help, I created a script that utilized regular expressions to extract the ticket numbers from the URL and format them in a way that would be easy to use with TextExpander.

After writing the initial code, I allowed it to sit for a bit and returned to it a few days later to refine and evolve it. By utilizing ChatGBT once again, I was able to further optimize the script and ensure that it was working as efficiently as possible.

Once the code was complete, I integrated it into TextExpander to create a custom snippet that could be used to automatically extract ticket numbers from URLs with just a few keystrokes. The result was a powerful tool that saved me significant amounts of time and effort, allowing me to focus on other important tasks.

This demonstration is just one example of how ChatGBT, Javascript, and TextExpander can be used together to streamline your workflow and increase productivity. Whether you're a professional looking to optimize your workflow or a hobbyist interested in automating tasks, the possibilities are endless with these powerful tools.
