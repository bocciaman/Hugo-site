Back in July I finally got a a new desktop Mac that will be my daily driver for the forseeable future. Here are the full specs for it:

_2023 Mac Studio_

- 32GB unified memory
- 2TB SSD storage
- Accessory Kit
- Back: Four Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-A ports, one HDMI port, one 10Gb Ethernet port, one 3.5 mm headphone jack
- Apple M2 Max with 12‑core CPU, 38‑core GPU, 16‑core Neural Engine
- Apple full Magic Keyboard with Touch ID - Arabic keyboard

_Monitor_

- Dell S2422HZ - Not a good purchase - but it will do for now, I hope to replace it in a few years.
