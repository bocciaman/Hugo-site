My YouTube channel hasn’t been active in over a year, and I want to share why. Life took an unexpected turn, and a series of difficult events pushed me into a place I never anticipated.

On May 20th, 2025, I lost my job as a Senior Marketing Analyst at my previous company. What followed was four exhausting months of searching for work. I applied to 125 different positions—yes, I counted—and received rejection after rejection. By October 2024, after months of uncertainty and frustration, I decided to take a leap and accept a position abroad with my family’s company.

What I didn’t expect was how difficult the transition would be. Living abroad was far more challenging than I imagined. I struggled to adjust to the new environment and routine, and I slowly slipped into a kind of depression where I didn’t have the energy or motivation to do much of anything. My evenings were spent coming home from work, collapsing in front of the TV, and zoning out. I didn’t have the mental space—or even enough privacy—to film the videos I wanted to share with all of you.

Another curveball was the shift from working on macOS to being fully on a Windows-based system. It may sound like a small thing, but for someone whose channel focuses on macOS and iOS automation, this change made it incredibly difficult to create the type of content I enjoy and that my audience expects. Every part of my workflow felt disrupted.

All of these changes combined left me feeling stuck, unmotivated, and disconnected—not just from my channel, but from myself.

But here’s the good news.

In January 2026, I plan to move back to the United States and return to a remote workflow that gives me the flexibility, tools, and environment I need to create again. Once I’m settled back stateside, the channel will pick back up. I’ve missed making videos. I’ve missed sharing tips, tutorials, and ideas with all of you. And I’m genuinely excited to return with a fresh mindset and better content than ever.

Thank you to everyone who’s stuck around, reached out, or simply kept my videos on your playlist. Your support means more than you know.

I’m looking forward to a new chapter—and I hope you’ll be there with me when it begins.
