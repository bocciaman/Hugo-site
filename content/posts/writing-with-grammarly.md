In this video, I created a Keyboard Maestro macro to automate a better writing experience with Grammarly. I got the original macro from [David Sparks](https://www.macsparky.com/), who is an automation superhero to me. I  modified one action in the macro to get it to work on my Mac because there is an issue with the 'click on found image' action in Keyboard Maestro. In any case, the macro takes text from your clipboard, opens the Grammarly site, and pastes it into the text writing field in seconds for you to start editing.
